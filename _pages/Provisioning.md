# Tenant Creation Walkthrough
This is a supportive video that does not require any actions since your tenant is already provisioned. The video demonstrates the initial provisioning task for New Webex Contact Center. The initial walkthrough assumes that a new partner is creating both Webex Control Hub and Webex Contact Center Gold Tenant. This process you will use in the feature for setting up your GOLD tenant using Webex Calling.

# Trial Tenant Setup 

> The bonus video shows how to set up a Trial Tenant. The steps are similar but since this is a trial tenant it is not necessary to go through the ordering process. Trial tenants are a great option for partners who are willing to start with the configuration before billing started. 
> **Please note, by default the trial feature is not available in the Partner's CH. It can be activated only after approval. Please contact your PSM/CSM**.
