# Lab 0. Part 1: How to create Webex Contact Center Trial

> **Please note, by default the Webex Contact Center trial feature is not available in Partner Hubs. It can be activated only after approval. Please contact your PSM/CSM**.

# Lab 0. Part 2: How to create Webex Contact Center Trial remotely

> The video shows how to set up a Webex Contact Center Trial Tenant Remotely. This is not a common way of creating a trial but one of the scenarios to use this type of provisioning is when Partner administrator went on holidays and there is no one who can add a Webex Contact Center Trial to an existing customer organization. This demonstration shows how to add Webex Contact Center Trial to an existing organization by using another Partner Hub. CSM can perform a role of remote Partner Administrator.
